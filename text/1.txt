December 16, 1987.
<br>
I am fifteen years old living in a one-person apartment in Honolulu and working two jobs. I haven’t heard from my parents in two years. I’m glad I haven’t. The old house was like a jail cell. No, not like a jail cell- when you’re in jail, there are screwed-up people like you that you can talk to. People willing to admit how shit the world is and how awful of a person they’re willing to become, be it in broken English or something else. The old house was more like… an inescapable sunday school sermon. I can complain about it all for hours, but here and now, I’d rather not think about it.
<br>
I love my new jobs, I really do. School, back when I was in it, gave me mixed feelings- it was a big relief to be out of the house and in a classroom, but the kids there were… well, they liked to use me as a convenient punching bag more than they liked to talk to me. But here, I know people that will talk to me like I’m a person instead of a liability. We’re all in the same boat, propping up fake names and identities and carefully weaving new narratives for the cops like little perfect models of Atlas, holding up our own made-up worlds on our backs.
<br>
Maria is the full-time bartender. She watches me from across the room during my second shift, after 8 PM, when I don a cheap leotard with glued-on rhinestones and a bunny-ear headband. She’s got a shotgun under the counter and turns it on anyone who tries to tear me from the pole without the right price. Her gaggle of rich boyfriends are scattered across the country- they come and go, Alex the photographer and Tim the cruise captain and Mike the oboist. When they stop by, once every few months or year, they talk about the latest experimental film they’ve seen or a book they’ve been working on recently, to little avail. She smiles and nods, gives them a few shots on the house, and then takes them to the back rooms. I know those rooms well. The dim reddish lighting, the garish faux-velvet covers over polyester couches. I prefer the dancing part to what goes on back there, but there are small joys, even in those rooms. A large spider lives in the corner of the ceiling of my room there, over a neon advertisement for some foul-tasting drink or other- every time I get taken to my back room, I get to check up on them, see what they’ve caught for the day. I wonder if the other bunny-girls have spiders to look at too.
<br>
When it nears the end of my shift, and the people lingering around the stage are nearly blackout drunk, I bid my ados to them, and head over to the bar counter to chat with Maria after changing back into boy clothes. Well, moreso, she chats with me- I’ve always been a bit on the quieter side. She’s exhausted by the time I stop by- she gets on before I do and off at around the same time-  but there’s always enough energy left, as she says, to deliver a final round- a bitter vodka mule for her, and sweet peach martini for me. She helped me make the fake ID that she cards each time around, since I’m still just enough on the young-looking side that Angel gives her a stern look if she doesn’t. Angel is the bouncer who spends eight hours a day standing in one place, giving stern looks to people, and another four hitting the gym. Maria apparently asked him out once, about a year and a half ago, and he deflected answering until his shift was over- and then never let her bring it up again to him. She calls him an overripe fruit. I didn’t have the gall to ask her what that meant until recently, when she called me something similar.
<br>
“<em>Keiki</em>,” she calls me this morning, her tone contemptuous, “You’ve got two appointments tonight. Be quick with the afternoon rounds.”
<br>
I hear her take a sip of coffee over the phone. The city has good coffee shops, she tells me. She’d offer to take me out to one sometime, if she weren’t ten years older than me and getting called a poor slut even without an even poorer slut by her side.
<br>
Rainy winter days like this are nice- they wash away a bit of the incessant cigarette smell that hangs like a sheet over the streets. The rainy season is quieter, too. During the summer, we get calls almost every night from angry white women, demanding us spill the beans on their husbands who have apparently been using their vacations to try out the exotic ladies like we’re some kind of bakery giving out storefront sex samples. Maria ensures them, in her most cheeky hotel-receptionist voice, that every guest to our fine establishment is vetted before entering and that legal liability is on the guest themselves if they happen to be making a scandal out of it, so if you’re really so concerned, take it up with local authorities or a divorce lawyer. What she doesn’t tell them is that we have a small sum going to said local authorities as a ”fuck off” tax for matters like these. It isn’t much- we can’t afford much while the board is funneling all our resources into getting a luxury casino set up in central Nevada- but it’s enough to convince them not to care.
<br>
That’s all to do with my second job. My first- a 9 to 5 by technicality, but a contractor job in practice- pays a decent bit more on the days I do get work from it, though those days aren’t all that frequent. I haven’t been working this first job for nearly as long as my second, but the team says I’m a natural. And what a team it is. These people have been working with one another for five, maybe six years- I’m their “adoptive newbie” as they call it, and for a while they were all over me with questions about how I made the roster for assignment and how I even got this job in the first place. They’re less pointed with the interrogations nowadays. The question is no longer “what’s wrong with you,” but “are you okay?”
<br>
“-Still, even if you say you’re fine, you really should try and get back into high school, Otogami-san. If for no other reason, the way you talk about robotics- a GED would let you get much further into that field. With a job like the engineers back home have, you wouldn’t have to worry about not having enough contracts to pay for medication. Why you’re wasting your childhood on an awful thing like this, I’ll never understand.”
<br>
Codename Daimoku is a professor at some big-name Japanese university. They’re the oldest of the team, but still incredibly young for their job- Maria, when I told her about them, actually recognized the name. Told me they were a child prodigy, earning a doctorate off a paper on a new particle or quark or something of the sort they discovered when they were 25. Even though I’m the only minor in the team, the others still call them the dedicated adult of the group. When I tried to make fun of them for their height within the first week of me being on the team, the others made it pretty damn clear that that wasn’t okay.
<br>
“It’s not a waste, and I’m not your kid,” I tell them, “I like this job, and it pays well. As long as I’ve got money, I’m doing something right.”
<br>
“Your father had money too. Would you say he was in the right?”
<br>
I don’t want to think about him. Instead, I ask, “So why are you joining the mission today? Don’t you have, like, final exams to grade or something?”
<br>
“I don’t <em>do</em> exams,” bitterness hangs on their tongue with every word.
<br>
Though there’s no way I can know their situation through and through, I like to think Daimoku wasn’t that different from me, back when I was in school. I was a straight A’s kid, a math whiz, a “delight to have in class” in spite of my vocal hatred of tests and homework (<em>if they can’t teach it in class</em>, I reckoned, <em>that’s their own shortcoming to deal with, not ours</em>). My teachers, as much as they didn’t give a single shit about their job, still showed more concern for me than anyone else in the world ever did, back then. Dai’s got loftier goals than I do- often going off on spiels about educational reform and encouraging equity and social justice in different academic fields- but they still find their niche in the world of academia more than anywhere else, even a team like this. They’re the most frequent absentee on our missions, usually because they’re either not in the country or are giving a guest lecture at a local uni around here. During missions themselves, if we get paired up, they’ll spend a lot of the time trying to give me mini-lectures. Right now they’re trying to teach me organic chemistry, since back at the apartment, I’ve been running my own experiments on my own with distilling different gasoline samples I find strewn out back of the local gas station, seeing if I can up the firepower of my gun by pumping it full of compressed gases.
<br>
A quiet yet gruff voice interrupts our little chat, “Cram it, you two. Boss’ll be here any minute.”
<br>
It’s our de-facto leader within the group, Codename Backjack (<em>no</em>, he insists, <em>it’s not a racist thing from the boss, he chose the name for himself</em>). He’s working towards a degree of his own in cultural sciences. He’d been so involved in a local martial arts studio since early childhood that you’d think the place raised him. Now he’s doing volunteer work there, on a straight-shot path to take over ownership of the place, since the old master is starting to get too wrinkled to lift a fist. Punching isn't all the guy’s good for- I actually referred him to Ruby Vice, and now he’s our resident pianist (the records were wearing thin anyways, so it was due time we got someone for the part). In turn, he gave me what’s now become one of my greatest joys in life, an NES of my own, along with his copy of <em>Metroid</em>. We’ve been pretty good friends since I started this job, though he’s consistently disappointed at my stupidity, considering he and Dai are my de-facto teachers in any topics beyond a middle-school-level education now. Still, he says he’s thankful for that role anyways, since he winds up dragging me to the library more often than not when trying to explain something to me, which is just about the most relaxation he and I get in any given week.
<br>
The other two team members, Codename Ace-in-the-Hole and Codename Cue Ball, sit together in the back. Just looking at them, the two ladies couldn’t be more different. Ace is perfectly still, staring straight down with a trepid look as she waits, beads of sweat already forming on her pallid forehead. Her black hair was cut recently enough to show, though it’s still long enough that she has a bit in the back pulled back into a neat bun, tied in an expensive-looking ribbon. She’s in full uniform, black suit over white shirt and a matching tie, a silver flower pin of her own adorning the breast pocket, and earrings with blue gems that are probably real sapphires, one of her countless family heirlooms. She usually doesn’t tell us much about her family, opting to let us visit and meet her retired, saccharine grandparents for ourselves instead, but Blackjack and I have a theory that she’s probably from some line of royalty or other. Cue, meanwhile, knocks her knees together and shuffles back and forth, humming some cumbia or other. She can’t sit still. She never can. She’s a bit of a slow one, but not enough so to dissuade the boss from allowing her on a team like this. When she sees me staring back at her, she smiles a big dumb smile before going back to humming and chewing on the collar of her shirt. Dai’s apparently been trying to teach her better English, since her current ability is… incomprehensible, at best. I don’t know how you could have the patience to teach someone who gets distracted as easily as she does. When I was in class with kids like that, who shouted and threw paper airplanes at each other while a lecture was going on, I felt like I was losing my mind. I’m lucky she doesn’t bother talking much, or else I’m sure I’d lose my mind having to be around her.
<br>
Then, the moment of truth: the door opens, and in comes the boss. Today, like every other day, he’s dressed up like your standard accountant, all suit and tie in black and white. He’s got these very slight wrinkles along his cheek and above his brow, the mark of a man armed with a disarming smile who isn’t afraid to use it to get what he wants. He greets us all with that self-same smile, and in a voice that would make any cookie-baking grandmother reminisce about old radio hosts, announces:
<br>
“Bit of a change of plans, boys. Pack your bags. We’ve got you on a flight to New York tomorrow.”
<br>
Everyone’s a bit stunned silent by that, except for Dai, who immediately pipes up, “New York! We are not some- some <em>messenger pigeons</em> to be sent about wherever your next secretary lover lies, sir. What would you have us do so far away?”
<br>
“The state, not the city,” the boss replies, his plastered grin never fading, “A good friend of mine at Berkeley has been looking to get his hands on some data that the military’s stuffed in a remote little lab in the forest. Seems like they’re doing some bleeding edge nuclear research out there that any physicist worth their salt will pay a fine sum for. I’m sure you of all people would understand, sweetheart. You folks are to get past security, nab the data, and return it right here to this table, face down.”
<br>
“The sum being?” Blackjack raises an eyebrow.
<br>
“Fifty grand. Split it amongst yourselves however you’d like.”
<br>
That silences us all. The boss, recognizing that his work here is done, sets down a clean white envelope on the desk- probably flight tickets, hotel information, all that- and leaves without another word.
<br>
Fifty grand. Fifty thousand dollars! I’ve never had that much in my life, let alone as a payment for one of these missions. The most I’ve gotten out of it before was a thousand, and that was for a high-stakes political assassination. I look back and forth between the other two in my row, Dai and Blackjack, hoping to gauge their reactions- they look about as stunned as I do. I’m sure Maria will have my head when I call in and tell her I can’t make it tonight, and that we need to cancel the two appointments, but just about nothing's gonna hold me back from an opportunity like this, perma-drunk women with shotguns included.
<br>
I resolve to stop by the bar early anyways- if for no other reason, I need a preparatory drink myself.
