“Gah!”
<br>
It’s a sharp pain in my leg. I sweep it up, look down, look around- the surroundings are a whirlwind of white, broken only by the dark shroud of Blackjack- he’s carrying me. His expression is a mix of confusion, pain, fury. The pain in my leg- it looks like some kind of golden rod, stuck in there, blood slowly welling up around the point of contact.
<br>
“Damn, too slow,” I hear him murmur as his eyes fall on the golden rod. He peeks around the corner of something- a tree trunk, it looks like? It’s all so blurry. I can’t tell what’s going on at all. After a glance, everything suddenly shifts, light obscured by darkness as the world moves around me.
<br>
I cry out, “What’s happening!?”
<br>
He calls back, muffled under the sound of moving fabric, “I don’t know.” Stress permeates every fiber of his voice, and it only loops right back to me. Situation’s out of control. We’re all screwed.
<br>
“Are we fighting something?”
<br>
“<em>Something’s</em> fighting <em>us,</em>” the light returns again as he speaks, the sound of fabric slowing to a halt. I peek up again- looks like he’s setting me down or something, trying to reach down to do something about the thing in my leg. It gives me the chance to look over his shoulder, too, up at the sky, to see what’s giving chase.
<br>
It’s definitely… something. I’m not sure how exactly you’d describe it. Like a big white ball with an even whiter aperture in the center surrounded by two gyroscopically spinning golden rings flashing with rainbow lights along their circumference, along which what looks like sort-of humanoid outlines hovering above each ring, like hooded figures sort of bowed in a prayer position. Between each of their… hands? appendages? things? in the front, a golden glow begins to manifest, extending outward into a rodlike shape, ending in three prongs. That must be the thing in my leg, then. There’s a distinct stench about it, one that flavors the air with a tinge of homesickness- the smell of salt, like the sea breeze. The entity is making these weird sorts of resonant… hums? Kind of like some weird new-age ambient track. I can’t tell if it’s meant to be some form of communication, or just a passive thing it does. Through my blurry vision, I’d have to make the poor estimate that it’s about sixty feet away up in the air, and twenty feet in diameter. An easy shot, but I’ll need to be able to stand first.
<br>
“Hold sti-”
<br>
“<em>AUUUUUGH!</em>”
<br>
That was not apt warning. Fucking <em>OW</em>. The rod is out now, indeed with the two prongs at the end now painted dark-red, and the throbbing in my head and blurriness of my vision gets a whole degree worse. I can’t make out Blackjack’s facial features anymore, or where the wound on my leg is other than a big spot of red and the sheer waves of pain coming from it. Well, there goes my chance of being able to land that shot. Jesus christ-and-a-half, I need a drink after this, if I’m still kicking then.
<br>
Over the new thumping in my head, I faintly hear Blackjack asking, “Can you walk?”
<br>
“<em>Can I walk!</em>” I spit out. God. Is there any point in trying to do anything now? I can feel the blood pouring down my leg in swells, one big droplet after droplet along the trail, leaving me lightheaded. Figure I’m probably going to pass out in thirty seconds or so. I’ve never handled blood loss well, I’ve never handled stress well, and the combination of the two feels like a gravitron the way it’s throwing me for loops.
<br>
“Sorry,” his voice sounds increasingly distant, “Couldn’t let you keep it. They’re tipped with somethin’, couldn’t you smell? I could… try to take some potshots with your rifle, if that’s alright.”
<br>
No, he can’t fire a gun for shit, I’ve seen him try. Our options right now are far too limited to play risky like that anyways. Grasping for straws, I offer, “Your… your contract, thingy, can you try that?”
<br>
The signing bonuses for joining the Hand were different for each of us, including different special provisions. ‘Contractual defenses,’ they called them. I never got one of them, but the others did. I’ve seen them all in action before, and the others’ are pretty consistent- Daimoku’s heavenly scripture, Ace-In-The-Hole’s vision wax, Cue Ball’s butterfly effect. But I’ve never been able to figure out what exactly Blackjack’s does. Sometimes it’ll completely incapacitate a person, sometimes it’ll just make him fit in a bit better wherever he’s at.
<br>
“My contractual defenses?” he murmurs, sounding conflicted, “I don’t know if it’ll work on something like this. Or what it’ll do, if it does. …Might fuck me up if it’s something my body can’t handle. You sure about this, newb- Snake-Eyes?”
<br>
Things are starting to go dark. I try to talk as quickly as I can, “Just. Try it. It won’t kill you.”
<br>
<em>It can’t kill you. I wouldn’t be able to live with myself if it did. Please, don’t die here. You’re all I have.</em>
<br>
Among the darkness, I hear something like the crunch of an apple, lost to the echoes of falling snow as the senses all blend into one cold, agonized thing. The way reality seems to mold and rise and bubble up around me, it’s like <b><a onclick="advance()">drowning.</a></b>
