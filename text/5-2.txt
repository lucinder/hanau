“Ears up, newbie,” comes the hiss from Blackjack.
<br>
Cue is the only one still outside- she’s burning the bits of the bodies that weren’t caught in the explosion. Dai and Ace have gone on ahead, Ace now wearing the uniform of the guard she spoke to. Us two hang in the middle, listening in close for their calls over earpiece.
<br>
Something feels… off. I’m usually fully in control of myself during missions, head in the game. My surroundings are usually exactly what they are in real life. But I’ve been shifting a bit out of focus as I walk, the room seeming to tilt. It reminds me of… I don’t know. The things I think it reminds me of, I mostly don’t remember. Maybe I’m teetering on the edge of another episode, and my brain is just conjuring up decorations to this whole experience. I swear I took my meds last night, but sometimes it does kick in without explanation…
<br>
A crackling noise snaps me to attention, and then we hear Dai’s radio-muffled voice, “Maps line up. There’s a hundred floors top to bottom, the surface being the first, and the lowest being the hundredth. Elevator isn’t monitored. The last guard didn’t know where the documents were, but did know there wasn’t a separate storage area for them, so they’re likely stored in the experimental rooms on the lowest floors.”
<br>
“Did you manage to get-“
<br>
Blackjack starts to ask something, but there’s a sudden ear-splitting screech from the ear mics that has us both clapping a hand to them to shut out the sound. “<em>Shit, shit, shit!</em>” I can barely hear him shouting over the noise, tearing the tiny device out with some difficulty. My hand is over the speaker but the sound is so loud that it’s sending vibrations up my arm.
<br>
It fades after a few moments, after which I hear Dai quietly mutter, “Are you two alright?”
<br>
“Half-deaf now, but sure, let’s go with that,” slowly putting the earpiece back on, Blackjack huffs out loud what I’m thinking. Once it’s on, he looks around quickly to see if the noise attracted any attention.
<br>
“So you heard it too,” Dai sounds frazzled.
<br>
“Whatever ‘it’ was, yeah,” he turns and suddenly grabs my shoulder, “Newbs, there’s… there’s some weird… stuff going on here. I dunno if… if we’re just… running into things, or if this was a setup and they knew or…”
<br>
Shaking his head, he shifts focus back to the doors ahead, “Look, I’ve seen you work the computer in the library before. Do you know how to code?”
<br>
I wasn’t expecting the question, but I manage, “Ah, um, sort of? I know Basic, since the library computer runs it, and I wanted to make games for my brother when he grows up. A little bit of C and Pascal too. What for?”
<br>
“I figure, since they’ve got a whole lot of science goin’ on here, maybe they store records digitally. You wanna peek into some of the rooms down the hall, see if they’ve got computers set up?”
<br>
“Well, if it’s a totally different model, it might- I mean, not the Commodore, then it might not support Basic- but-” I shut myself up, considering he’s giving me a look like he doesn’t understand a word I’m saying, and resign to, “…I guess I can take a look.”
<br>
“Damn right you can! I’ll watch your back,” he gives a thumbs up, and I try the nearest door- unlocked. Peering inside, I <a href="" onclick="advance()">see</a>
