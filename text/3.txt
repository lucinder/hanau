There’s not much at all for me to pack. A few sets of spare clothes, a toothbrush, tampons, and my medication, that’s all. Though I have a rifle I prefer to use on assassination missions, this is a heist, and I hopefully won’t have to do much killing, so I plan on buying a cheap pistol when I get there and pawning it off before I leave. Food is a non-issue, despite Ace’s constant prying into my near-empty cupboards, her horrified cries of “haven’t you been eating at <em>all?</em>” when she sees dry bread, a bottle of sriracha sauce, several-day-old takeout pizza, alcohol from work, and not much else. “Yes,” I say back to her, pointing at the leftovers, “obviously I have, if I have food.” It does nothing to ease her mortified look. She demands I at least have a slice of the pizza before I go, and with some degree of reluctance, I oblige.
<br>
We’re last to the airport, Daimoku having gotten off the bus just minutes prior and Blackjack and Ace having been waiting for us for almost half an hour, the former picking up the latter around the crack of dawn. Blackjack’s ride is a truck that has no business being as functional as it is, a hull of creaking rust and loose bolts on lopsided wheels that he claims could probably drive up Everest given the chance. This is the guy that, when asked, told me that <em>no</em>, he <em>wouldn’t</em> get his check engine light checked, and it would turn off on its own. Ace was adamant that we rent something with at least leather-back seats and an engine muffler when we get to the mainland, to which Blackjack told her to do it herself if she cared so much. So she did. At least now won’t have to deal with… whatever semblance of a vehicle he would’ve picked out, if any.
<br>
The plane is late. People in sunglasses and flowery shirts flood out of the terminal as though they’re expecting an eternal summer the moment they set foot on the island. Kids are dragging parents to stands with the cheap faux-flower leis that every hotel and its mother buys up to sell. Some people point and gawk at Blackjack and his hair, which he braided for the occasion. He doesn’t mind the kids- they’ve just never seen a brown man with long hair that isn’t in dreads or a ‘fro, he says- but to the adults he gives this harrowing, soul-rending stare that he’s mastered over the years. He offers me a cigarette while we wait, to keep the more entitled folks away, but I decline- it’s already going to be stuffy enough on the plane.
<br>
He only wears the braid on special occasions, but he looks gorgeous with it. It keeps his vibrant cheeks and distinct collarbone uncovered, and with the thin, low-collared shirt he wears, you can see the outlines of his thick breasts. I quickly resolve to sit next to him, my mind already spinning with anticipation for leaning against his shoulder or chest and falling asleep. “What are you, man, a baby?” I can already hear him jeering, but not shoving me off or telling me to stop like Dai would. He’s always so warm. Maybe it’s all that rage, the fire in his heart, that keeps him like that. I could do with some warmth of my own on cold days like this.
<br>
I often wonder what it’s like, being in his shoes. We all have problems in the head on this team, but of the lot of us, he struggles the most socially. Even Cue gets along with folks better than he does- sure, language is a barrier, but she’s so cheerful and gullible and eager-to-please that people can never assume she’s got bad intentions. But Blackjack struggles. He struggles just going to the bank and staying level-headed with the receptionist when asking them to check why he’s getting overcharged for medical costs out of nowhere. He struggles when a woman with a stroller sits next to him on the bus and won’t make an effort to stop the baby’s crying. He struggles with approaching his old high-school girlfriend’s parents, trying to ask them to help him out, telling them that the girl won’t leave him alone and is blackmailing his coworkers at the dojo. The man so desperately wants to get out there and enjoy a life among other people, but that endless rage swirling in him finds ways to escape time after time, latching on to the slightest little irritations and changes, and it grinds his chances at social mobility to a stark halt. I wonder if they’ll make pills to wash away the weight of that anger, like mine wash away the familiar faces in my peripheral. Maybe someday, there’ll be a pill for everything, and we won’t have to form these little freak-clusters that we do.
<br>
There are two things I know for certain Blackjack holds close. His culture, and his family. Not his old adoptive family, no, but his sensei and us. In fact, I don’t think there’s a thing in the world more rightfully holding of his contempt than his old adoptive parents. They bought him like my mother was bought, and tried everything in the world to- as they put it- “save” him. He was to know as little as possible of his origin, his people, the very history of the island he lived on. After all, he wasn’t a child of the old kingdom anymore, but the kingdom of God. For the majority of his life, his hair was kept cut short, his mouth washed out with soap if he so much as mildly complained about his school, and his skin was washed with so much force each night that he came to classes looking red and raw. He learned the names of every saint, learned that the islands were discovered by Captain Cook, and learned that he was something subhuman who could only reach heaven by dosing himself constant self-policing and regret. His parents took one look at Jennifer from his math class, the child of one of the wealthy coffee-plantation-owners on the rainy side of the island, and decided that they would get to work when he was no older than eleven arranging their marriage in years to come. By the time he was my age, they were together, and he thought it was natural, thought it was inevitable that this girl he felt nothing for would eventually grow on him. Then a year later, he met Jennifer’s ex by pure chance- a flowery choir boy not all that different from how I used to be, all numbers-and-logic-obsessed and tripping over his words in normal conversation and a foot shorter than him, and he fell hard.
<br>
The reason he was kicked out of the house, Blackjack claims, <em>wasn’t</em> because he was discovered sneaking out at 10 PM on a Saturday night to meet up with the guy at the bar, but because of how he exploded at his parents earlier that night when they found and took away his copy of <em>Silent Spring</em>. The whole getting-caught thing was apparently just icing on the cake.
<br>
Well, his boyfriend’s parents moved out with that choir boy in the same year, and he was stuck with no home, no partner, and a very angry ex-girlfriend. It was sheer luck that he wound up here. The school his old parents sent him was one of those upscale private Christian schools, the ones with local police on duty at the campus, but the public high school in the same town- the place I was supposed to go to- had no such security. He was breaking into the place, into a science classroom to see if there was anything expensive he could nick and pawn for quick cash, and Daimoku happened to be there after hours talking to the science teacher about their guest lecture the next day. They wanted everything to be set up <em>just right</em> so that there was no risk of the demonstration failing.
<br>
The teacher, who was already half-asleep listening to Dai go off about electric interference, didn’t notice Blackjack peering through the door, then frantically trying to slip away. But Daimoku did, and immediately cut off the lecture to excuse themself to the restroom.
<br>
Blackjack thought himself fast enough to escape the situation if he just made a mad sprint for the window he came in, but Daimoku was, and still is, faster. They don’t look the part, but they’re unfathomably quick on their toes, and have arm strength to boot. Maybe it’s years of carrying around particle-accelerator equipment, but they can lift any of us- Blackjack included, on that day, as they grabbed the thief by the scruff of his collar and pinned him up against the wall.
<br>
While he hung there in shocked silence, Dai looked him up and down, “You’re not a student here. What’s your name, boy?”
<br>
The words that escaped Blackjack were involuntary, but he was far too bewildered to understand exactly what Daimoku had done to him at the time.
<br>
“Beleli Matagama. …But I go by Anhu. Beleli was my parents’ name for me- those damn old-money planet-killin’-”
<br>
“Matagama, hm? That’s a Japanese name. And Anhu… that’s an interesting one. Sounds Hindi. But you’re not either of those,” Dai pondered this as Anhu’s rant faltered back into his own thoughts. They had heard the full name before, certainly, but it wasn’t one they were familiar with on a professional basis. All they could think of was, “…codename?” 
<br>
“Blackjack,” he blurted, and not moments later realized the magnitude of what he had just said. We operators aren’t allowed to give our real names and codenames to the same person, unless they’re also an operator. Which meant, “You… you’re one’a…”
<br>
“Tabernacle Division. Data retrieval services. Ikāna Kusanagi, codename Daimoku,” they smiled, and it was genuine, but behind that smile hid an air of lurid pride, “You know, I didn’t think I would have the fortune to meet a fellow Phantom’s Hand operator so far from home. You’re with their Curie Units, hm? I hear they pay quite well.” 
<br>
“…Not full time. And not on one of their… teams. I just move some money around sometimes, man. I don’t have anything goin’ on with them for the next… uh…” he could hardly believe himself, giving away all this information so easily. It was like this Daimoku character had cast a spell on him. <em>Hang on</em>, he thought, <em>a spell… data retrieval services, did they say?</em> He suddenly snapped to attention, and felt along his neck, where indeed a strange bump now resided.
<br>
“Oh. Oh, you <em>fucker!</em>”
<br>
Daimoku let out a haughty laugh, “Took you long enough! Come on, now, let’s take this somewhere educational. The hallway’s hardly a place for a lesson.”
<br>
In Daimoku’s retellings of this same story, their tone is boastful; in Blackjack’s, it’s seething. The tea those two shared together that night was the start of a bitter yet lively rivalry that still shapes their interactions to this day. As it turns out, Dai was better suited to field data collection than high-profile interrogation, so after a few months’ worth of paperwork, they were transferred out of the Tabernacle Division and into the Curie Units. And as it turns out, Blackjack was better suited to planning these insane, super-detailed heists than being the criminal equivalent of a milkman, so after maybe a day’s worth of paperwork, he was enlisted. Enlisted, by happenstance, in the same unit as Daimoku and our resident pyromaniac Cue. The Phantom’s Hand was probably trying to shift things around in the unit big-time, considering two of its members had retired in the same year, and the third- the assassin before Ace- was looking for a different position. Ace’s recruitment to the team a year later set the unit in stone until I came along. She was as new to the Phantom’s Hand as I was, but had a history with the CIA for a few years prior. Me, I was <em>new</em> new. I was a gamble that I’m still not quite sure why the boss was willing to take.
<br>
For such an extraordinary organization, though, the bulk of the missions are entrenched in the mundane. Right now, in the rush of all the movement that comes with getting onboard the flight for this mission, I forget to ask Blackjack if he’ll sit with me, but he invites me to his aisle regardless. I don’t have to ask why- he’s told me before that of all the members, I’m the nicest to sit quietly with. Ace worries too much, Dai talks too much, and Cue moves too much. But I just sit there, leaning into his soft, warm shoulder, while he stares out the window over the clouds. See, it’s hard to think of each other as operators, even on duty. We’re just folks trying to go places, like anyone else here. We’re just people.
<br>
I don’t have many dreams of the future, but when I do, there’s room for Blackjack. He’s the closest of the team to my age, three years older than me. If we both were a bit better off, I think I’d like to get a bigger apartment, so the two of us can live together. Or dreaming bigger yet, a cabin on the beach with a fireplace that we could sit by during the rainy winter, and drink tea or cocoa together, with an armchair for reading. Maybe then, he’d think of me less as a liability and more as a real partner or friend, like he thinks of the others.
<br>
There’s the fifty grand from this mission too- if we split it even and I get ten grand, maybe I could get a tiny house with that, but I don’t know how long it would last to pay for the water, heating, and electricity. Budgeting out $2500 for grandma, $1500 for rent, $600 for medication, $800 for groceries for the next few months, and $3600 to pay off other debts, I’ve got $1000, give or take, for the rest of the month. Definitely a lot, but definitely not enough for a house. Besides, it costs a fortune to live anywhere except the slums here. The beachfront properties are mostly hotels or millionaires’ summer homes. Maybe someday if I’m a millionaire, I’ll buy one up and start scaring the neighbors away so their homes can be bulldozed to make room for community housing. Mr. Wu, Blackjack’s sensei, could retire to a community then, instead of living alone in the attic of that lonely dojo.
<br>
Day fades through shades of pink and baby blue into night, and the river of brilliant sunlight that pours over the clouds disappears. During the later hours, some of the land is visible, and it looks like an alien planet, with lakes of mint green and rust brown and land like a patchwork quilt. We pass over the mountains when it’s already dark and can’t see the land below, but there are twinkling lights on occasion from scattered towns. Then a massive cluster of them approaches during descent- “mira, la <em>big apple!</em>” Cue points and exclaims, waking up a couple in the seats in front of her who glare back- and it starts to feel like my heart is rising up into my throat. My ears pop again and again, and before we know it, the roar of the landing gear wakes the remaining sleepers up.
<br>
It’s my second time ever having flown on a plane. I don’t really understand why the others hate it so much. They’re always saying, oh, the flights are the worst part of the missions, the people coughing and the crying babies and the unbreathable plane air just to name a fraction of the hell that is flying, and you can’t sleep with the awful seats and there’s no leg room. But how do you even notice those details to begin with? The moment we take off, my mind leaves the plane behind and starts rolling through memories like plays, and animating movies to go along with the songs I most enjoy, playing on repeat in my head. I’m not in a stuffed cabin full of people- I’m in the sky, and in the sky, I can lose all touch with reality without it getting me dragged away by cops for loitering.
<br>
Now once we disembark and break free from the funnel of the gate, anchoring back into reality is difficult. The flow is goes from traffic-jam slow to midnight-freeway fast. Every person in the airport moves like they’re going to miss their flight in five minutes. Where the airport at home has waves of people that flow out and disperse, like the ocean as it presses up against a lagoon, here it’s whitewater rapids of crowds pushing on and ahead, weaving in and out and cutting corners to try and get from point A to point B as fast as they can go. People in New York hate slowing down, says Dai. They are born fast, grow up fast, and die fast. They wouldn’t have it any other way.
<br>
Cue insists that we get pizza almost immediately, and after some back-and-forth with Dai, we pick up a boxed pizza to share later. Later is only fifteen minutes away, of course, just a cab into the city and then a quick jaunt to the hotel, where we all share a room. It’s nothing fancy. Two beds with paper-thin blankets for the five of us. The girls take one bed, and the rest of us take the other. We’re awake enough, at least, to briefly bicker and complain about who keeps stealing all the blankets, who needs to shower or otherwise, but it all fades fast.
<br>
I dream that night. I dream of a swirling dark abyss, the feeling of overwhelming pressure at the bottom of the sea, glimmering lights all around like eyes or little twinkling stars watching. I am drowning, alone, and my screams make no sound. Or maybe I am not alone- the shining stars watch from the dark- but they watch on, uncaring, as though I were not there. The sound of ocean waves rings through my head. They have the same rhythm, the same meter always. No ship, no matter how great, can change the rolling of the waves. And me, alone in the darkness? I am made a part of them effortlessly. My throat closes up, and I shut my eyes, but the blinding lights have burned themselves in. It's… strange. A dream like this should be frightening, but I am not afraid. Though the pain of drowning resounds throughout my body as strongly as ever, it doesn’t feel bad. I feel like I could stay in this abyss forever, sink deeper and deeper into the dark and never look back.
<br>
The sound of Cue and Ace giggling together, doing each other’s makeup in the morning wakes me up. They’re more excited than anyone for the heist today. The other two, Dai and Blackjack, they’re also awake but not nearly as lively. Dai’s rummaging through their suitcase and making sure everything is neatly folded.
<br>
“They were s’posed to bring your rifle this morning, kid. I’d ordered it to be sent ‘ere,” the bitter complaining begins from Blackjack, addressing me before I’ve even gotten out from under the sheets.
<br>
I check the clock quickly- a bit after five, not too bad, “That’s alright. I was going to go buy a pistol secondhand before we set out anyways. Want to come with?”
<br>
“Hah, suit yourself, man. I’m stayin’ in here as loooong as I can,” he leans back against the wall, downing what looks to be his third espresso in one fell swig.
<br>
Grabbing my coat and matting down my bedhead with the baseball cap he lets me borrow indefinitely, I take one last glance at him refilling the espresso cup and remark, “Don’t overdo it.”
<br>
“Eyy, was that sarcasm from you, newbie? Didn’t think you capable of it. Dai’s teaching you well,” he’s left snickering to himself, and once I’m out the door, I can still hear the muffled sound of his voice rambling on.
