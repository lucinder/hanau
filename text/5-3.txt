Delights of a green paradise swiftly faded into a concrete slate of jaded disillusionment. As beautiful as the islands had once first seemed, the harsh reality of life here quickly took hold: such beauty was reserved for those who could afford it. Her mama was always excited to hear a fantastical tale, over the phone, that she could not spin for very long, and responded in turn with the same complaints as ever about the heat of the summer sun beating down upon the factory, how the steam made it so much worse. She was glad, at least, that she was not stuck back there, working the steel machinery and assembly line like mama and Enrico, but the work here was nowhere near the fairytale she had been told it was, spending her twelve-hour days rushing between customers she could barely understand, carrying searing-hot plates that left her fingers burned and blistered, her arms under the uniform scrawled full of the names of orders she knew she wouldn’t remember.

During the nights, she retired to the apartment she shared with a man from the military, Louis. The two couldn’t be more different, nor could they be more similar. Neither could speak coherent English, nor could they properly speak each others’ tongues, though Spanish and French were similar enough that many things could be extrapolated with an educated guess. Louis worked the shipyard, getting on and off duty on around the same schedule as she did, and though the two didn’t speak much, they shared a mutual understanding of the sheer exhaustion that came with those last two hours of work. They laughed about how their coworkers thought they were banging, while in truth Louis wanted nothing to do with having a woman as a partner, and she wanted nothing to do with having a man.

She had an hour, in between coming home from the day job and reporting for the night job. It was enough time to shower, read just a bit further in her small collection of books, and if she was lucky and Louis volunteered to be her alarm clock before he went off to bed, take a short nap.

Mojira knew her coworkers thought she was an idiot. For the most part, she didn’t care. The job paid well, and she got to try new things, things that went ‘boom’ and ‘pop’ and lit up in beautiful lights and sounds like she had always wished she could see back home. Most of the time, anyways, she didn’t have to talk to the others, though she tried to be sociable where she could, despite the monumentous barriers of language and culture and her own attitude towards life in contrast to their… resignation. Yes, that was the word for it. The others, it seemed to her, had given up on life, taken into their hearts a sullen darkness that overshadowed their ability to enjoy everything in the moment. She understood, to a degree- that was how she felt during the peak hours of the day job, when it was just one order after another with no room to breathe, no room to think, no room to remember herself. But the missions were always a breath of fresh air. How lucky they must be, she thought, to consider these the monotonous part of life.

The newbie didn’t entirely seem to have lost that spark, though. If she could just get him to talk, <b><a onclick="advance()">then</a></b>
