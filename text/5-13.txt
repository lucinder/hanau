There it was. The slivers of light, peeking through the darkness of the containment cell. Two ugly beasts of the earth staring down at it- but these ones wore not the helmets of the captors, nor the coats of the researchers. As soon as the hatch was opened just enough, it burst through the crack and unfurled itself in all its magnificence before them.
<br>
It stared down at the earthlings, analyzing every aspect of their bodies. They were young. No older than thirty years, it ventured to guess. One had the biology of a female, the other of the male, but neither dressed the part, so it suspected they were on the more approachable side of earthling behavior (those that hadn’t yet been brainwashed into adhering their binarist presentation system were always more understanding, it had noticed)- beyond the simple courtesy of releasing it, that is. The shorter one had a tumor growing near their left lung, but the taller seemed in good health, though both bore strikingly thin bones, and strange marks- on the palm of the shorter one, an unfamiliar word in some language or other, and on the irises of the taller one, a similarly unreadable script lacing around their circumferences. These marks were brimming with energy, though not a type it was familiar with at a glance.
<br>
“Verification: there they are,” Delta confirmed what they already knew, “Our saviors.”
<br>
“How pitiful it is, that we need rely on them to be saved,” it spat back, its long-held grudge against their kind gripping its tone.
<br>
It did not have much confidence in these ones. Humans had already tried and failed to keep them free once. Should this group fail in turn, it would be no question that terms of containment would soon become terms of execution. If worse came to worst, it had already informed the others to take the bodies of their liberators, using what human connections they may have to buy time and afford some mercy from their fellow humans. They were a horribly self-centered species, those humans were; one need only make a convincing enough act of being one, and suddenly you were afforded the great plethora of luxuries their kind indulged in, at least to the degree that their courtesy allowed. There were still roadblocks, of course. A gratingly nonsensical currency system using their ridiculous number system (base ten? Seriously? One would think they’d at least settle on something reasonable like a binary-adjacent system; it could think of no other reason than a strict adherence to their biology, akin to reverence at that point), the expectation to dress one’s outer shell using materials purchased with said nonsensical currency, a confounding grammatical structure of their language- though that part, at least, Delta had under control-, a steel-based domesticated beast that apparently everyone was supposed to learn to tame known as a “car”… these would all come in time, it supposed, but they would have to be quick on their feet to adapt once they were outside of the facility.
<br>
While Delta conversed at length with the humans regarding something-or-other, it prodded them each to test their reaction time and the tensile strength of their flesh, both on the better end. Peering outside the cell, the walls of the rest of the facility were much thinner, and it saw on upper floors a few groups of panickedly-mobilizing guards splitting up to take on the upper and lower floors of the facility for sweeps. Most of the remaining researchers on the upper floors had been moved to the bunker level. A few stragglers, those particularly dedicated to their subjects of study, were staying behind to gather crucial documents. Up on the surface outside the facility, it saw three more humans of the renegade group, two close to the entrance and one a bit further away. Well, mostly human, at least. One of the nearer two was quite the odd specimen. Their entire body seemed <b><a onclick="advance()">to be a</a></b>
