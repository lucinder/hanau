The air feels different now.
<br>
<em>Hot. Ugh, hot, so hot!</em>
<br>
I shoot up. Panting. Warm, musty air is blasting into my face from a car’s air conditioning, Queen is blasting on full volume from the radio, interrupted by the <em>ra-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta!</em> of Cue’s chain-gun fire out the rear window. It feels tropical out here, but I can see the howling gusts of sleet hitting the windowsides, feel flecks of the icy wind hit my face like tiny knives if I look up and over. My body’s in this awful position, halfway upright and halfway laying down, suspended off the middle car-seat like I’m falling off a bed, my upper torso in the chest of a facility guard- no, that’s Ace, she’s doing her mirror thing. Someone’s sweater is tied around my leg, stained black with dried blood on the fabric. Other than the occasional lashes of wind, it’s impossible to tell how fast we’re going. Outsides of the windows are totally obscured by white.
<br>
Ace’s arms wrap around my sides, propping me up to a bit of a more comfortable position, “Doing alright there? Don’t move too quickly, you might reopen something.”
<br>
“I- yuh, I’m fine,” I lie. Still pretty lightheaded and <em>something</em> feels wrong, something else, but I can’t put my finger on what. After all the hallucinations earlier, I don’t know how much of my memory of all those events was real, and how much I dreamed up. If I’m not seeing things now, at least the leg injury part was real.
<br>
Looking around, I tally up the others- Dai in the driver’s seat laser-focused, Blackjack riding shotgun but looking unconscious in his seat (there’s a bit of blood staining his forehead, but I can’t tell from what), Cue blasting out the rear window at <em>something</em> behind us (I can faintly hear a helicopter over the howling wind and gunfire), and Ace holding me on this side. All five of us are still intact, mostly. That’s a good sign.
<br>
“Didja get the documents? You and Dai?” I peek up at her. She nods, momentarily pulling out what looks like a small bundle of paper from a well-hidden pocket.
<br>
“More than just the documents.”
<br>
She gestures, looks down at something under the seats in front of us. I turn too, and just like before with that thing in the sky, I really can’t aptly describe what I’m looking at. They’re these tiny, black, squirming things. The closest I can think of is the basket stars at the aquarium, but if they were a bit bigger and their skin(?) entirely pitch black, shimmering like oil. Occasionally, streaks of color flash and illuminate along the edges of their tentacular appendages, shining like the neon lights of the city in the deep of night.
<br>
“What… are they?” with my one working leg, I gently prod at one with my foot. Instantly, it latches on with those little appendages, kind of spirals its way up to my pant cuff like a corkscrew, lifting the unusually heavy golfball-sized orb in the center of those appendages up onto my foot.
<br>
“No clue. The documents describe a bit about them, if you want to take a loo-”
<br>
“<em>Baja!</em>”
<br>
It flies by the window. Something gray and handheld. I hear the noise of the blast at the same time as Cue’s shout, but don’t have time to react. There’s a white light, then brilliant red, <b><a onclick="advance()">then</a></b>
