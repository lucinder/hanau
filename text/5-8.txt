see here, I don’t even know what you are, let alone who. So if you try any funny business, you’ll wind up no differently than,” Dai turns to gesture at the corpses of the guards that once stood at the front of the room.

“I understand your apprehension. But rest assured, our motives do not conflict with yours,” speaks the shadowy thing.
<br>
Glimmers of shining lime-green droplets illuminate the lower half of its form, a smooth black surface with the sheen of tar, with a long line across the bulbous form from which the luminescent beads percolated. Though no bigger in width than the tip of Daimoku’s thumb, still they hesitate to get any closer, for they can see trailing behind its body tiny strands of black, trailing off to an indefinite length, which with a good degree of strength and precision might be capable of slitting their throat, or perhaps even snapping their neck. Caution always comes first in matters of the unexplained. They have met too many a devil to cast it to the wind.
<br>
It speaks again, seemingly with some degree of labor, “Do not… attempt to touch me. That right is reserved for my kind; you would surely be burned to a crisp if your finger fell upon my lifeblood, and besides that, you would not be capable of lifting me.
<br>
Down the hall is a room, 8051, with a pin code to access. The code is 9633. There you will find and release our judicator; they can take care of the rest.”
<br>
“And this… judicator, is the same species- same thing? As you?” Ace responds this time, raising an eyebrow.
<br>
“It is. I am a mere runt; it is of proper size. And it will not speak to you. It cannot. I alone hold that power.”
<br>
“Why is that?”
<br>
The shadowy thing makes a noise like a sputtering whistle, suddenly retreating a few inches, the strands beginning to curl in around it. A ripple of green light travels down from its body through the strands, ending in a rapid-fire burst of bright flashes, to which Ace and Dai instinctively recoil, shielding their eyes. After a few moments of silence, the shadow speaks again, quieter than before.
<br>
“I… apologize. This injury impairs my thoughts. To answer your question, it is my sacred gift. A human would not understand, for you are born weak and fruitless, incapable of maintaining yourself without a provider.”
<br>
Dai gets a bit of an exasperated look on their face as they turn away, following Ace as she makes her way out of the room, “Heavens, I expected at least a little xenophobia on this trip, but this is not the… person… I thought I’d be hearing it from.”
<br>
“Its voice sounded a lot like Ka- like Snake-Eyes’s, don’t you think?” Ace allows herself a giggle, “And it’s matching colors too! I’m sure if he saw, he’d say something like, ‘oh, why wasn’t I born into a body like that, why do I have to deal with being human?’”
<br>
“Assuming he would say <em>anything</em>? You could put a dragon in front of him and he probably wouldn’t make a peep,” Dai joins in the snickering between them.
<br>
Their laughter quickly fades: footsteps from the stairwell tell of more guards coming. Dai slips behind the door, beginning to trace a pattern into the air as Ace remains out in the open, ready to draw their unsuspecting <b><a onclick="advance()">gazes.</a></b>
