<em>Okay, no, there’s definitely something going on. That wasn’t a memory.</em>

I reach out to Blackjack to get his attention, but he seems transfixed on something, looking straight down. Tapping him gently on the shoulder doesn’t seem to work, so I clear my throat, and…
<br>
“Uh… Blackjack?”
<br>
“Huh?” he looks up. His face seems a bit more pale than usual, “…That wasn’t- you saw that too, right?”
<br>
“Saw… what?” I don’t want to jump to conclusions. Maybe he saw something on the floor- it would be selfish to assume that just because I’m delusional, he is too.
<br>
“The tank. The water. There were people running past…”
<br>
…Definite not what I’ve been seeing. But it does sound like a delusion, so maybe I’m not alone for once.
<br>
“Ohh, thank god, I’m not the only crazy one-” I murmur, and then speak up “I saw… other stuff. Like Dai and Ace were- they found- something… alive?”
<br>
“Do you think… whatever’s in that tank,  was…” he squints, starting to pace towards the stairs- elevator’s probably shut down, so we’ll have to take the long way down. Then, he suddenly straightens up, stopping dead in his tracks.
<br>
“Hold up. We all heard that screech over the radio, yeah? And Ace was with Dai when they called in, but… Cue hasn’t called in.”

My heart sinks in my chest as he and I both about-face towards the entrance. She was supposed to be our outside watch, covering our asses while we recovered the data, making sure to notify us well in advance if she heard sirens or saw choppers or so much as heard anything out of the ordinary. She should’ve at least called to <b><a onclick="advance()">confirm that</a></b>
