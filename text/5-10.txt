The sounds of the city wash away in a rush of anticipation as the other girl releases her hand. She was usually never out this late, not for anything except the job- she made it a point to be back home by eight, for all the tales she had heard of what happens to pretty girls like her who stay out too late. But Ghomuera was none of those ever-present, skulking threats that her mama spoke about on the phone. In her blue summer dress and thigh-high socks and floppy hat, she seemed the type to suggest an afternoon picnic over any crude debauchery, to simply wake up one morning capable of speaking to the doves like a modern-day snow white. Indeed she looked the part, peeling down the socks to reveal icy-pale legs, surprisingly toned in spite of her small frame. Surprising for anyone else, perhaps.
