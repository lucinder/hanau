No sooner have I returned from the pawn shop with a busted-up pistol than are there two large packages sitting outside the hotel room, one rifle-shaped and one chaingun-shaped. Guess Dai’s getting a free pistol.
<br>
The latter of the two packages must be Cue’s- her beloved <em>mamacita</em>, she calls it, that she uses for blowing holes in SWAT squadrons. It’s one of the only things in life she’s willing to hide from her family. Other oddities like Ace and crazy stories from the job get blown front-and-center when she’s at the payphone, rambling so fast that I can’t even catch the few words I do know in the language. It’s crazy how people like <em>us</em> all come from religious families- hers, mine, and Blackjack’s catholic, Ace’s jewish, and Dai’s… well, I don’t really know. Dai doesn’t have family, is the thing.
<br>
It's not like they told us, either, their whole situation. Dai’s got a knack for making other people spill the beans while never themself revealing any personal info. We only learned anything about their past because Mr. Wu, Blackjack’s instructor, had far more of a close-knit relationship with their family than we could ever otherwise guess. Mr. Kusanagi and Mr. Wu were both around our age- early twenties, that is, so more <em>everyone else’s</em> age than mine- when Nagasaki got hit with the nuke. They were working for a military-government lab there together at the time, and were onsite at the time, far enough from the main urban area- but their families lived in the city. They both lost everything on that day. When other researchers like them started being rounded up and taken prisoner by the Americans, that’s when they knew they had to get out of there. Wu was lucky. Stuck a job with the Atomic Energy Commission and has been working as a government insider since, living a solitary but sustainable life. Kusanagi was not. He spent years on the run, picking up and losing plenty of women along the way such that pretty much anyone in the world could be Dai’s mother, but was eventually pinned down by the feds. Guilty of war crimes, with a penalty of death. One of his final acts was pooling all his remaining money into a fund to send Dai to college back in his homeland so that they could finish the work he never could.
<br>
I met Dai a bit before actually signing on to the Phantom’s Hand, in a lucky bout, since they were leaving the islands in only a few days when Blackjack referred me to them. He said Dai would be able to tell me more about the organization and benefits themself than he ever could. Daimoku was at their own hotel, and I’m almost certain they wouldn’t’ve answered the door for me, had Blackjack not been there as my escort.
<br>
“You don’t ask the boss what goes on behind the scenes. You don’t ask anyone outside of your division, if you want true and straightforward answers. What you do is you go straight to the devil itself, because a devil cannot lie,” they told me, in a tone devoid of heart or soul.
<br>
They’d always been the enigma out of the group, knowing far more than they should, but I suppose it makes sense given their background and current jobs. They’re arguably closer to Mr. Wu than Blackjack, who basically lives with the guy. Working at the university they do, they’re always in close contact with state-sponsored laboratories, many of which have some super involved military history. And as the oldest of us all, they’ve had the most time to get a hold of powerful connections. Hell, I think they actually know our boss’s real name, which is saying a lot. They probably know <em>my</em> actual name. …If you could even consider it that, at this point, given that I never use it, and nobody uses it in reference to me. Everyone just uses my fake name nowadays.
<br>
Kane Otogami, sniper first class.
<br>
A “fake” name. A name that I can simultaneously call mine, and never truly call my own. It doesn’t even mean anything. I just… like the sound of it.
<br>
There’s a thought that keeps nagging at me in the shower, staring ahead without seeing. Stuffing the guns in the trunk of the rental, Cue snapping at me about how I’m handling hers wrong and I’m gonna break something, getting in the backseat while Dai and Blackjack scuffle over radio stations, gazing at the passing bars and antique shops and burger joints and thrift stores on the city outskirts and just… thinking. That same thought, incessant. <em>Am I Kane Otogami?</em>
<br>
I’m certainly not the short girl in the school uniform and long tied-back black hair and bruised-up pale skin walking down the bridge on a hazy mid-June day. I’ve got tattoos in place of bruises, and boy-cut short hair, and a bit of a tan in place of pale skin, and sterling silver piercings instead of lip gloss, and a light in my eyes that didn’t used to be there. I’ve got… friends. And an income. And a home, even if it’s cramped and dirty and the roof leaks. And a gun. I’ve got a <em>gun</em>! I didn’t think I’d ever come <em>close</em> to having a means of self-defense, two years ago.
<br>
But I’m still… me. Two years doesn’t change much. I can do stoichiometry and break into an ATM now, I guess. And I get less queasy around blood. But that’s all that’s changed up in my head, as far as I can tell. You’d think that dying would change a guy fundamentally, but no, I’m still here, still quiet, still pretty much willing to suck up to whoever I need to if it means I can live comfortably. Look at everyone around me- they’ve grown and changed and molded with each other and adapted to the changing world and here I am, the same. The same.
<br>
I didn’t just give myself a name when I ran away. The gun- I bought it from a guy hitting his late seventies, who didn’t let me into his shop until I had cut my hair and grown a few inches and deepened my voice enough- I called her Black Betty, after a song I heard on the radio. She felt like a sin to me. I was getting something that could only destroy lives, and I was going to use it for exactly that purpose, just so I could earn enough to keep going. It was exciting, buying the thing, thinking <em>this is what I’ve become</em> when holding it, lost in a sort of noir detective type fantasy of standing over the body of some politician drenched in blood. Like this forbidden fruit in my mind. Opening the door to the idea that, <em>look, you’re no longer a passerby in this world, you’re a horrible predator that destroys more lives than it saves.</em>
<br>
And then I killed, for the first time.
<br>
It was a man at the bar, I remember, a bulky white skinhead who I more or less assumed was an off-duty cop. In the post-shift rounds, I saw him slip something into the drink he bought for me. He offered to take me home, leading me out back to the alleyway where he said he had parked. I told him I needed to grab something from my locker first, and hid the gun in the umbrella holder by the back door. Let him get a few paces ahead of me. Then in a sort of clumsy swooping motion, hurled my body to the side and tore the gun up from the holder, pulling the trigger as he started to turn around.
<br>
It hit kind of between the neck and shoulder area. There was blood, but not much, not nearly as much as I thought- just an initial burst with bits of grayish flesh mixed in, and then a dark stream that started to dribble down his chest and stain his shirt. He staggered back a few steps, a deep yell escaping him as his hands found the wound, and looked up again, and without thinking I shot a second time- right above the eye.
<br>
He had $80 on him. The cops took about twenty minutes to show up on scene, by which time, I was already back home. I didn’t even get blood on my clothes at all.
<br>
I felt nothing.
<br>
A slight relief, I guess, that I had a bit more going towards rent, but… I didn’t feel for the guy or his corpse.
<br>
And then I hated myself more than I ever had before. <em>That was it?</em> I killed a man, and I felt nothing. <em>Nothing.</em> I had <em>killed</em> someone, taken a life, wiped away someone’s hopes and dreams and probably devastated his family and done something truly irredeemable and I didn’t feel bad at all? What was <em>wrong</em> with me? I really was a monster, like my father always said, a truly despicable thing without a human heart.
<br>
So I’ve been killing people and hating myself for two years now, and today we’re driving to probably go kill a whole lot more people. Blackjack is looking over the facility map we’ve been provided, sharing insights and planning a route back and forth with Dai, and Ace and Cue are excitedly chattering on about what the facility might be hiding and what big discovery is in the documents we’re tasked with retrieving. And I’m still staring into the window at blurry gray storefronts and my own reflection in the fog. <em>How many lives will I take today?</em> I do wonder, on days like this, how many people in the world wake up and ask themselves the same.
<br>
It doesn’t take long, or at least it doesn’t seem to, before the gray is gone and replaced by a mix of dark green and white. Endless pines spread out before us, cloaked in thin December snow, the damp cold air pervading into the car and quieting the existing conversations. We don’t get snow back at home, except for the high mountains. It’s beautiful, but also a little sad. I can imagine Dai growing up with snowy winters in the city, having snowball fights with friends and building snowmen and all sorts of things I’ve never experienced. A bitterness swells in my throat, thinking that I <em>could</em> just go and do these things too if I had someone onboard with it… but I’m already struggling just to prove to these guys that I’m not a little kid, and giving in and asking for childish things like that would just make them laugh and call me adorable, probably.
<br>
“…Kane? Kane!”
<br>
I look up. Cue has a hand on my shoulder, shaking me somewhat vigorously to get my attention. There’s concern in her eyes, but a trivial kind.
<br>
“Oye, newbie, I thought you fall asleep! You ever has drink hot cocoa?” she asks, shifting inconveniently so that instead of a hand on my shoulder, it’s her whole elbow.
<br>
“Cocoa? …Not that I can remember,” I try to rack my brain for any instances of it. There’s a canister of the stuff available in the office alongside a box of tea packets, next to the water dispenser, but I never tried it myself, “Why, are we planning to get some after the mission?”
<br>
She shakes her head vigorously, “No, no, but you can ask An- Blackjack, I says- he makes it home-made. I says-a him, amigo, es damn good stuff, but never good as mamá’s, ¿sí? Cause mamá uses our pimentón, he don’t has that- but if he buy it from the supermarket extranjero, the one downtown, you know they has the good stuff, he can make it good. Not as good as…” and she continues on for several more minutes in this manner, while I pretty much tuned out after the first mention of mamá. I think at some point she starts talking about what she’d do if she were president.
<br>
I turn to Blackjack in the front, since he was mentioned, “You know how to make homemade cocoa?”
<br>
He shrugs, keeping his gaze fixed, “Not well. I jus’ melt some chocolate bars into milk in a pot, sprinkle in a lil’ bit of cinnamon powder. Not the kinda stuff you have much of back home considering it’s still staying at a modest sixty-seventy-sum’n in the winter. …But on stormy days, yeah, i’s alright.”
<br>
I mull it over for a bit before working up the courage to open the question to Ace and Dai, “Have… you guys tried his cocoa too?”
<br>
Ace nods and Dai doesn’t respond so I assume it’s a no from them. Peeking over the middle-seat wall that is Cue, I ask her, “Is it good?” to which she nods again.
<br>
“What, you don’t take my word for it, newbie?” Blackjack snorts, finally looking back at me, “I’ll make you some, once we get back from the mission. …Rest’a yous gotta promise me you’ll finish the leftover milk before we fly out, though-”
<br>
“Matagama-san,” Dai interrupts suddenly. The car slows to a halt on the roadside, with no real parking range so we’re rolling into snow before parking, “We’re here.”
<br>
“<em>This</em> is the place?”
<br>
Blackjack looks out the window, scanning with visible concern. It’s not hard to see why: there’s no facility here. Just lines upon lines of pines covered in a sheet of snow. We’re on the side of a highway in basically the middle of nowhere.
<br>
Daimoku straightens up and opens their door, “Obviously not <em>here</em> here. It’s a bit of a walk. They’re not just going to put the secret lab standing out next to the road, yes? Bundle up, all of you.”
<br>
The “bundle” I’ve brought is the warmest thing I have- a hoodie, jeans, and a pair of boots Blackjack let me borrow. It is bitter, biting cold out here. I can feel my breath burning in my throat as I walk, stinging salty tear ducts going frostbitten, the others never failing to be amazed at how red my cheeks get as I shove my hands as deep in my pockets as they’ll go. There’s no paths out here. My body shudders and trembles with every uneven step through the snow, boots already having been soaked through. God, I can only imagine the awful musty smell of these socks tomorrow that’ll permeate across the suitcase.
<br>
I feel a sudden hit against my side, and hear a yell- looking over, Cue is breathing heavy with bright-red hands from a recent snowball, and Ace is telling her, “Stop, stop, don’t! He’s barely got a jacket on!”
<br>
“Not him? Guess you’re O-K target then!” she smirks, and seconds later the two have dissolved into breathy laughter, quickly tearing up snow from the ground as they walk to pelt each other with. I see Dai roll their eyes shortly before they, too, get hit on the back of the head with a snowball, and promptly whirl around with a fuming expression… but they don’t say anything. They reach down, and quickly mold their own snowball, wordlessly joining the fight. It catches the other two off guard, and they both wind up with ice in their hair and faces even redder, dripping with half-melted snow.
<br>
I’m… jealous. I want to join, but-
<br>
No! No buts. Screw the cold. I might never get to experience this if I don’t now.
<br>
I don’t have gloves like Ace or Dai so the ice stings to the touch but I force myself to ignore it, kneeling just a bit to start putting together a ball. It’s not very soft, lots of pine needles and bits of plant debris mixed in here and there. Someone suddenly grabs my shoulder- Blackjack, I see, looking up at his half-angry-half-concerned face- and tries to pull me up.
<br>
“Kane, Kane- stop, don’t be fuckin’ ridiculous, you’re gonna get yourself sick-”
<br>
I give him my best attempt at what I think is going to result in puppydog eyes, or something like it, and he lets go.
<br>
“…Don’t… ruin the boots, okay?” he resigns, stepping back.
<br>
I nod, and join the fight. The others look concerned too, when I join, giving me the ‘are you sure?’ look- and I wipe that stupid look off their faces one direct hit after another. Dai first, then Cue, then Ace, and then I turn to Blackjack and hit him right in the cheek. He stops pretending to ignore us, now, and I see a bit of that fire he’s got in him let loose with the shout of “Hey! Bastard, get over here!”
<br>
And I’m laughing and panting and dodging and struggling to breathe and I’ve got a throbbing headache and I feel <em>alive</em>.
<br>
Dai eases off first. They get a weird look on their face, staring me down in a way I don’t really know how to decode. Then suddenly, I stop too- there’s this high pitched whine in the air, like a really high voltage machine just powered on, and I get a sudden sense of vertigo, like the ground shifted below my feet. I look up, trying to find the source, and upon seeing nothing, look down to see the others having stopped, doing the same.
<br>
“The hell was that?” Blackjack asks. Nobody seems to have an answer for a few moments, then Daimoku pipes up.
<br>
“…Closest I can think of is how plasma waves sound on ham radio. But we shouldn’t be able to- to hear something like that.”
<br>
“Great, so, what does that mean, the guards’re gonna have plasma rifles or something?” Blackjack sighs, beginning to trudge on forward through the forest again, “Either way, we… we gotta get going, stay on schedule an’ all.”
<br>
So we move on, following mostly in silence except for the occasional remarks between Ace and Cue. As we’re (allegedly) getting closer, based on the map, Daimoku suddenly shifts to walk close beside me, and taps my shoulder.
<br>
“I’d never heard you laugh before, Otogami-san.”
<br>
My mind kind of short-circuits for a second, trying to think of something or other to back-witticism at them. But they sounded too genuine.
<br>
“Ah… thanks?” I try.
<br>
“It was not a compliment. You… do you consider us friends?”
<br>
I don’t.
<br>
…It’s not to say I don’t like them. I do. They’re all fine people in their own respects, but the only one I really consider close enough to border on friendship is Ace. But it’s the sort of thing where, if I died, she would just wake up the next day and move on, maybe with a note of “well that sucks”. I’m pretty much an accessory to the group, not a part of it. Sure, dedicated sniper and all, but I don’t want to be liked simply on the merit of ‘that guy kills people for us’. I dream of a future with Blackjack, but I would be lying if I said he probably feels the same way.
<br>
Besides, they deserve better than me. I don’t bring much to the table. They’re all smarter than me in their own ways, more practiced adults, more responsible, more… empathetic. They care about the world and want to change it for the better. I see the injustices that happen in it every day and the best I can say is that <em>I want to live</em>.
<br>
“You guys are… fine. You’re nice, you hang out with me and treat me well. Spoil me a bit, to be honest,” it’s tough to put it into words. I don’t want to come off as hurtful, I just want to be honest. Dai doesn’t want me as a friend anyways, so what do they care?
<br>
Their next words are nearly whispered, “…But you feel we don’t understand you. You’ve been seen as different all your life, just like us, but for reasons that are justified, in your mind. You think what they’ve said holds true. That you don’t deserve the same luxuries afforded to everyone else, because of the way you are.”
<br>
I half-shrug, trying to make sense of what they’re trying to psychoanalyze out of me as I rationalize back, “Because it is justified. I kill people in the dozens without a shred of remorse, and I’m sick in the head. Cue is too, but she’s just a little dumb and blissfully ignorant because of it. I’m just a piece of shit who can’t tell real from fake and thinks the world revolves around me.”
<br>
Dai looks like they’re going to tell me off for being self-deprecating again, but they stop themself. They know it’s a losing battle. I’m glad I was able to stay quiet enough that Blackjack didn’t hear me, because he certainly doesn’t care how much of a losing battle it is when he does.
<br>
“If you could take any job, no consequences, good pay, you know you’d get hired,” they postulate, “What would you do?”
<br>
“Hm…” there’s a lot I’d love to do. Being a marine biologist and working at an aquarium. Getting a proper degree in physical chemistry and working on something like semiconductor design or handheld computers. Learning more about the islands, and teaching people the real history of it, not the school system’s whitewashed version, and fully learning the native language too. Making a video game, even if it’s just a text adventure, to tell stories to the group. Inventing a way to recycle nuclear waste back into usable materials. Studying the human brain, how it works, if we could replicate it with machines…
<br>
But there’s one easy pick that I think would keep me happy for a while, “A national park ranger, for the volcanoes back home. I think… knowing the history of the land tells you a lot about the history of the people on it, you know? We’re all animals, inseparable from nature like anything else. A lot of jobs out there focus on these… lofty abstract conceptual things, y’know, like markets and mathematical theories and all that, but the ground is always gonna be below your feet, and the sky is always gonna be over your head. The earth is… it’s physical. Imminent. Visceral, I guess. I… I like it that way. And it’s important for kids to learn, too, that they can’t escape to a fantasy world when things go bad- what’s here is here, and we can’t imagine our way out of it. Life is here, not in heaven or hell. If someone had taught me that, maybe I wouldn’t space out so much, I dunno.”
<br>
Daimoku nods, “And if you were in that job from the get-go, not doing this, would you consider yourself a good person?”
<br>
“I mean…” I shift to the side a bit. They’re right, I suppose, in that I wouldn’t need to kill anyone. But I still fear that the kind of person I am would result in hurting more people than I help, “If that’s all I’m doing, sure. But just because I like something doesn’t mean I’m cut out to do it, y’know?”
<br>
They look back at the forest ahead, letting go of my arm- I just noticed they had been holding onto it the whole time- and let out a bit of a whistling sigh. After a few moments, they remark again, in a low tone, “I wanted to be a paleontologist.”
<br>
“Paleontologist? What, studying dinosaurs? That sounds awesome. Why didn’t you?” I can feel myself getting louder with excitement.
<br>
“It’s the job market, mainly. Too few positions and too situational pay. Besides, it was more of a pipe dream of, you know, every kid’s desire to revive fossils into living creatures using DNA. And then you grow up, you find out that’s not in the job description. I mainly moved into nuclear research and teaching it since, well, I wanted to change the world. I still want to. A nuclear-based power grid would be much better for the environment, but…” their words fade into a hiss. They don’t have to continue; both of us know what happened last year, how the waves of propaganda coursed through the globe and how we’re probably going to be set decades back in nuclear innovation from a scare caused by skirting safety guidelines rather than the fundamental design. We’ve talked about it before. I feel their rage seeping into me when I listen.
<br>
They look up, then point ahead through the trees, gently grabbing my sleeve again, “There. You see it, in there? That’s our destination.”
<br>
It’s hard to see through the blur of snow and trees, but there’s a faint black-gray slaty patch off in the distance. Daimoku lets go of me, gesturing to the others to gather ‘round, and once we’re all in a circle, turns to Blackjack.
<br>
“So what’s the plan, lad?”
<br>
“No different than our usual setup. Kagami, Taja, you two’re the front, you approach looking lost,” he gestures to Ace and Cue respectively, “Kagami answers the questions, and chiquita, lo pondrás el explosivo, ¿si? Give us enough time to get through once the entryway’s breached. I’ll clear the way from there while you all hang back and check the rooms for the target docs. Kusanagi and Otogami take care of any stragglers. …Kusanagi, actually, you hang closer to Kagami once we’re in, you’re her backup if anyone sees through her front.”
<br>
“Best keep your mouth shut if you’re not going to use codenames,” Dai snaps, “They’ve probably got surveillance systems around the building, not just on and in it.”
<br>
“That’s Ka- that’s <em>Ace-In-The-Hole’s</em> problem, not mine,” he huffs, glancing over at the patch of gray among the forest, “Either way, the quicker we are, the less chance we get authorities contacted on us. Capiche?”
<br>
“Capoosh,” we respond in unison, per mission tradition.
<br>
“Then let’s go.”
