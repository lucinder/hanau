                The next morning, at around 6 AM sharp, Cue comes knocking on my door. She’s wearing a sun hat and light dress, something you’d expect to see a tourist in during high summer, and has her suitcase alongside her as well as a woven basket with a ribbon on it. She stares at me expectantly for a few moments before I sort of snap to my senses and gesture her inside, stepping to the side. She takes off her shoes and puts them in the few inches of free space there is by the door once she’s inside. Wealthier folks like to do that, I notice. I suppose I’m not wearing mine either, but that’s because I’d rather not sleep in tennis shoes two sizes too small on me. Cue always looks miserable when she has to come here, but she can’t bring herself to say out loud that it’s because she hates being cramped in the twenty square feet of space making up my apartment.
            </p>
            <p>
                She starts off with an unimaginably bad conversation topic:
            </p>
            <p>
                “My sister died last week.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Did she?” I echo, hardly realizing the weight of the words as I light the stove and fill a pot with water, “That’s terrible. How’d she die?”
            </p>
            <p>
                “There was a shootout in the park. Some hippies, they started throwing things at the police. Gabriela was there- she was with pópó, walking the dog- one of the rubber bullets hit her in the neck.”
            </p>
            <p>
                She has her hands folded in this half-prayer-like position, elbows shifting the table back and forth a little as they shake. The water is almost boiling now. Cue’s expression isn’t a frown, but something a bit more neutral, a bit more hollow, staring blankly down, like she’s seeing things that aren’t there. People have told me I look like that when I have episodes. Staring at things that aren’t there.
            </p>
            <p>
                Her voice is barely above a whisper when she continues, “She was only eleven.”
            </p>
            <p>
                I don’t quite know how to respond, so I pretend to be entirely focused on the pot while it hits a boil. As quickly as I can manage, I pour out the water into two mugs, set her oolong in one and my jasmine in another, rapidfire stir everything in, and sit down across from her.
            </p>
            <p>
                “…So, why’d you come to me, then?”
            </p>
            <p>
                She looks up at my voice, and her expression goes from hollow to pleading in an instant, “You said- I recall a few months back, you said you had a brother, who you lost. How did you… deal with that?”
            </p>
            <p>
                Ah. That. I hadn’t thought about it for those few months.
            </p>
            <p>
                “I didn’t… lose him. Not in the sense that you did,” I reply, trying to be sympathetic in spite of the rush of memories, “I just… you know how things went down, how I wound up here. I died in the public eye, but my brother survived. I couldn’t just let him go back to the old house alone, so I had to get into contact with grandma, see if she could take him in. She’s taking care of him now, and I give her about a fourth of my paycheck to make sure of it.”
            </p>
            <p>
                It's an oversimplification of the issue, of course, but explaining everything that happened that day would be a nightmare at this time in the morning. It was in the summer, the early June before school gets out and just about everyone from the teachers to the students to the faculty had stopped caring. I had never told my father about my brother’s existence. I was so afraid that he’d kill me if he found out, or worse yet, kill mother for something that wasn’t her fault. So every day when I packed up to go to school, I wrapped my baby brother in a jacket, tied the sleeves around his mouth so that he wouldn’t make too much noise, and hid him in my backpack in front of my textbooks and notebooks. I could only hope that he could breathe in there. When the other kids ran to the cafeteria to get lunch, I slipped away to the bathroom and took him out, nursing him and feeding him a spoonful of applesauce from a jar I’d filled with as much of the stuff as I could afford from the gas station. You wouldn’t believe how lucky I was that the school had lockers, instead of us having to bring our packs to each class after the last. It was noise that set him off. In the locker, he can’t hear the outside, and the outside can’t hear him. It’s the perfect place to hide.
            </p>
            <p>
                On that day in the summer, the sun was beating down on the pavement like a hammer, and we were all being crushed under the heat. The black asphalt wavered on the distant ends of the road, reflecting the sky above. A mirage, they called it, like they have in the deserts. Being the dumb kid I was at the time, I didn’t quite understand how that worked- mirages were supposed to appear when you’re really thirsty, and I wasn’t all that thirsty, so why was it showing up? That’s something that’s always bothered me, being told something is true when logical contradictions exist all the time. God knows it’s made worse by the fact that I can’t tell truth from lies, real from fake, dreams from normal days.
            </p>
            <p>
                There’s a part where the road runs along a bridge, and the sidewalk disappears, so I have to walk on the road itself and press myself against the railings. Most of the time it isn’t a problem, but if there’s a big 18-wheeler passing through, I tend to get honked at while pressing myself as far against the railing as I can, inches away from disembowelment. The close calls are rare, and usually only on really rainy days, so I wasn’t all that worried during the height of summer.
            </p>
            <p>
                It was quiet out. Not much birdsong on that day, which was surprising for how vibrant and hot it was. I was walking down the empty bridge, keeping my eyes on the road ahead most of the time, occasionally glancing over the railway to see the light reflecting off the glimmering ocean, the same glimmer as shining a flashlight on a landfill of beer-bottle glass. The beaches are dangerous nowadays, they say. Too much garbage and not enough sand. I heard about a boy in my class who found a dove stuck in a shopping bag on the shore outside his house, and tried to free it- it had a broken wing and could barely move. The boy- bless his heart, but I can’t be bothered to remember his name- tried to take care of it for a few days, until one day he went to check on it in the kitchen and it lay dead. Nothing had caused it to die. It just ran out of time. His mother was furious, of course, hearing that he had taken in a wild animal- but still, she buried the bird, and let the boy pick some flowers from their garden to make a little circle around its grave. People on the mainland think doves are a sign of peace, the boy said. Here, they’re just pests. The adults don’t care for them, so it’s up to us kids to give a damn.
            </p>
            <p>
                I heard the sound of a dove’s cry coming from the far side of the bridge, a rush of wind from the near side, and something hard hit my foot. I stumbled- was quickly getting up, not thinking anything of it- when the blaring of an 18-wheeler’s honk drowned out everything, and there was this crack along the length of my back. The world went spinning- it was, I think, what being struck by lightning must feel like, the whole connection to the body suddenly ripped away for a moment before being shunted back in, and maybe in that moment one could catch a glimpse of heaven, though all I saw was the light reflecting off the water again. Then I was back, my whole body feeling heavy, and the world was a dark murky green, with slivers of sunlight still shining through.
            </p>
            <p>
                There was this pressure everywhere. Reality felt like a hydraulic press on all sides, crushing my body, and a thought suddenly ran through my head, over and over, spinning circles- my pack wasn’t on my back. Was my brother okay? <em>Was he okay?</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                “How old is he, Kane?”
            </p>
            <p>
                Something I’ve noticed with the mission group- I call them by their codenames out of respect to their privacy and all, but they never call me by mine. It’s always Kane (or Otogami-san, in Dai’s case), never Snake-Eyes. I don’t particularly mind, since the man named Kane Otogami doesn’t legally exist. The name I chose was a shortening of who I used to be, and for a last name, my mother’s maiden name- one of many things she had been denied when my father bought her. It was the least I could do to avenge her memory, when I heard the news about what happened after I died.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Three. He’s twelve years younger than me.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “…He was only a year old when you ‘died’, then.”
            </p>
            <p>
                To think I was only thirteen, back then, and it feels like I haven’t changed at all. But the whole world around me nowadays is something that would’ve seemed alien at the time.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Yeah.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Do you think he remembers you?”
            </p>
            <p>
                I don’t really understand why, but a rage suddenly erupts in my chest at this, “What kind of question is that?”
            </p>
            <p>
                Cue goes quiet again. She looks down at her tea, but doesn’t sip it at all. Her eyes once again fill with that hollowness, that thousand-yard stare of a broken woman. At this point, the seeds of doubt have been planted in my mind- Cue’s no stranger to death. Before my hire, she was the dedicated assassin of the team. Surely this can’t be too different, right? Everyone bleeds. Then again, I think, why did they need me on the team, if not for her desire to move away from the position?
            </p>
            <p>
                I was no stranger to killing. Not before I took the position, and not after. Humans are desperate animals. We go to any lengths we need to just to survive. I get the cash off the bodies, and the doves get the meat.
            </p>
            <p>
                Cue is a bit different, though, I suppose. She’s a half-Chinese half-Polish immigrant from an upper-middle class family, raised with her little sister by her grandparents on the Chinese side since her parents set off somewhere doing god-knows-what. They moved here for retirement and brought her along, under the settler’s delusion of a natural paradise being the optimal place to grow up in. The folks are just about the nicest people you’ve ever met, with Mr. Kagami having run a restaurant in a California Chinatown most of his life- the one or two times Cue’s had me over, he made the best dumplings I’ve ever had. They love their green-dyed lawn and their Russian blue cat and their fancy new electronic water fountain out front. Their cherry floors are always vibrant and polished- nothing like the rickety dead wood we had at my old house- and the wallpapers and drapery all have that floral rococo style you’d expect of a fairytale castle in the German countryside. She’s all old-people and ironed-clothes and kitty-litter smell. Not a damn trace of someone you’d expect to culminate in the cold-blooded killer she became, and yet, here she is, with a nigh spotless assassination record while wearing a sun hat with a pink ribbon tied around it. God has punishing angels, she tells me, that are sent to do his dirty work. Sometimes they’re even demons, but they’re working under the Lord regardless. She says God is like a dragon- all strength and nobility, because we mortals need something strong and noble to lead us, not something weak-willed and amicable-to-all.
            </p>
            <p>
                I prayed with her for the first time when I heard my mother was murdered, and that the cops didn’t know the whereabouts of my father. I didn’t really know anything about God or Judaism or angels, but I was scared for my life, and the lives of my friends. She was the only one who seemed to understand my fear, and that entire day, she stayed with me, took me out for sushi and karaage, and then to a tattoo parlor. I had no idea that she had a second job too, let alone one here, until that moment. She pulled up her shirt, showed off her back- covered in tattoos. Swirling patterns of sword-wielding angels surrounding the image of a chained-up human heart. I got my first tattoo at that parlor that afternoon, a dragon running up the length of my shooting arm. Later that month, I heard that my father had been taken into custody, and that grandma and my brother were safe, and I started to believe in… something.
            </p>
            <p>
                “I know we fly today,” she says, “but until then, can I stay with you?”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Of course. Of course,” vigorously, I nod. I’d give her the same answer on any day. When this godforsaken cage of an apartment is empty, it feels like the world on the day I died, the air and the walls closing in and crushing me on all sides.
